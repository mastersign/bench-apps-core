Bench Core App Library
======================

This project is the core library for applications,
used by [Bench](http://mastersign.github.io/bench/).

The individual apps are described in the [`apps.md`](apps.md) file.

Take a look at the documentation for the
[syntax](http://mastersign.github.io/bench/ref/markup-syntax/),
the [app types](http://mastersign.github.io/bench/ref/app-types/),
and the [app properties](http://mastersign.github.io/bench/ref/app-properties/).
Apps are installed in the order they appear in the library.
This has to be taken into consideration, when organizing the library.
